# A Simulation Approach to Veritistic Social Epistemology

> In a seminal book, Alvin I. Goldman outlines a theory for how to evaluate social practices with respect to their “veritistic value”, i.e., their tendency to promote the acquisition of true beliefs (and impede the acquisition of false beliefs) in society. In the same work, Goldman raises a number of serious worries for his account. Two of them concern the possibility of determining the veritistic value of a practice in a concrete case because (1) we often don’t know what beliefs are actually true, and (2) even if we did, the task of determining the veritistic value would be computationally extremely difficult. Neither problem is specific to Goldman’s theory and both can be expected to arise for just about any account of veritistic value. It is argued here that the first problem does not pose a serious threat to large classes of interesting practices. The bulk of the paper is devoted to the computational problem, which, it is submitted, can be addressed in promising terms by means of computer simulation. In an attempt to add vividness to this proposal, an up-and-running simulation environment (Laputa) is presented and put to some preliminary tests.

The Truth Objection (p131)

(1) Determining the veritistic value of a practice means determining its tendency to promote or impede truth.
(2) The veritistic theorist cannot normally be assumed to know where the truth is in the applications she is studying.
(3) Therefore, the veritistic theorist cannot normally determine the V-performance of a practice.

The Computation Problem (p133)

> The computational problem has its root in the fact that assessing the veritistic value means collecting and processing tremendous amounts of information about various applications of the practice in question, including applications that have not actually been realized but are only possible. Processing large amounts of data is precisely what we use computers for, suggesting that the computational problems could be solved by means of computer simulation.

The implementation of simulation itself introduces a range of possible errors

> Moreover, when actually implementing a design like Laputa, a lot of minor decisions have to be made that can potentially affect the outcome. (As always, the devil is in the details.) There could also be programming errors compromising the output. The bottom line is that the actual implementation of a design like Laputa can itself be a source of error and controversy. (p138)
