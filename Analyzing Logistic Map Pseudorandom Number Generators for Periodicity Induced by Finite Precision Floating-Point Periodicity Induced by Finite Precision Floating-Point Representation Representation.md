# Analyzing Logistic Map Pseudorandom Number Generators for Periodicity Induced by Finite Precision Floating-Point Periodicity Induced by Finite Precision Floating-Point Representation Representation

> Real number implementations in finite precision are detrimental to the periodicity of chaotic PRNGs. Ignoring this reality makes chaos-based PRNGs deceptively appealing for random applications. FPPC algorithm can comprehensively analyze the periodicity of truncated real number series generated by a recurrence relation. Using these results one can make informed decisions about the appropriate use of a chaotic PRNG with respect to its conventional counter-parts. The results revealed about the logistic map do not appear competitive with conventional PRNGs (p14)
