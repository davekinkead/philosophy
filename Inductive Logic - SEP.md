# Inductive Logic

> An inductive logic is a logic of evidential support.

Inductive logic extends the notion of total deductive support to partial inductive support.

> In a good inductive argument, the truth of the premises provides some degree of support for the truth of the conclusion, where this degree-of-support might be measured via some numerical scale.

For evaluating the usefulness of any inductive logic ...

> Criterion of Adequacy (CoA):  
> The logic should make it likely (as a matter of logic) that as evidence accumulates, the total body of true evidence claims will eventually come to indicate, via the logic’s measure of support, that false hypotheses are probably false and that true hypotheses are probably true.

One form is Enumerative Induction ...

> Enumerative induction is ... only applicable to the support of claims involving simple universal conditionals (i.e., claims of form ‘All Bs are As’) and claims about the proportion of an attribute in a population (i.e., claims of form ‘the frequency of As among the Bs is r’). 

Enumerative induction is insufficient to justify hypothesis evaluation.

Another is Bayesian logicism ...

Bayesian approached based on condition logical of syntactical statements are also flawed because the rely on a posteriori evidence for their generation.

Bayesian subjectivism attempts to assign probabilities to agents' degrees of beleifs about the state of the world and claims.
