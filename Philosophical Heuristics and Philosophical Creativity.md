# Philosophical Heuristics and Philosophical Creativity

## Alan Hájek

Possible 

> Why care about what is possible? Because what is possible is relevant to various things that philosophers care about—claims of necessity, supervenience, entailment, validity, equivalence, and conceptual analyses, according to all of which certain things or combinations of things are impossible. Moreover, philosophers often deploy thought experiments in support of their positions; when they do so, they typically assume that the scenarios that they have us imagine are in some sense possible. p20

Brute force philosophy

> And if you have some programming skills, you can write a program to do the hard work of finding the structure for you. (p27)

>  Examples of using computer tools to discover philosophically interesting technical results can be found in some recent papers by Branden Fitelson. His (2008) shows how one can put to good philosophical use a user-friendly decision procedure for the probability calculus, and his (MS) shows how first-order theorem provers and model finders can yield an interesting generalization of Gibbard's theorem that, given certain seemingly plausible assumptions, the indicative conditional collapses to the material conditional. p28
