Testimony IEP

https://www.iep.utm.edu/ep-testi/

The epistomology of testimony concerns how we should evaluate beliefs formed from the claims of others.

> When someone tells us p, where p is some statement, and we accept it, then we are forming a testimonially-based belief that p.

> For our basic case of testimonially-based belief, let us say that person T, our testifier, says p to person S, our epistemic subject, and S believes that p.

When is S warranted in believing p?

> Discussing the basis of different beliefs presupposes that one important way we should categorize beliefs is by where they came from. The basis of a belief is its source or root. ... And when someone tells us that p, and we accept it, we form a testimonially-based belief that p.

## Internal issues (S-side)

> When is a testimonially-based belief justified, or rational, or reasonable, or permissible, or within our epistemic entitlements?

Reductionism vs Anti-reductionism (see @coady1973)

> Speaking broadly, reductionism views testimony as akin to inference and places a relatively heavy burden on the recipient of testimony, while anti-reductionism views testimony as akin to perception or memory and places a relatively light burden on the recipient of testimony.

External issues (related to T)

> Must T know that p herself? Must T’s testimony even be true? Must T reliably testify that p?


Hume vs Reid

> “[T]here is no species of reasoning more common, more useful, and more necessary to human life, than that which is derived from the testimony of men, and the reports of eye-witnesses and spectators. … [O]ur assurance in any argument of this kind is derived from no other principle than our observation of the veracity of human testimony, and of the usual conformity of facts to the reports of witnesses.” (Hume 1748, section X, at 74.) 

Testimony is reducible to observation, memory, and inference.  We might know p from T but our confidence comes from earlier instances of other p's being justified by OM&I.

> “[I]f credulity were the effect of reasoning and experience, it must grow up and gather strength, in the same proportion as reason and experience do. But, if it is the gift of Nature, it will be strongest in childhood, and limited and restrained by experience; and the most superficial view of human nature shews, that the last is really the case, and not the first. … [N]ature intends that our belief should be guided by the authority and reason of others before it can be guided by our own reason.” (Reid 1764, chapter 6, section 24, at 96.)

Testimony is irreducible. We just believe and this faculty has justification.

The inferentialist logic ...


>  T is telling me that p;
>  T, or people like T, have generally been reliable in the past telling me, or other people, things like p; so
>  T is probably reliable on this occasion; so
>  p.

@audi1997 holds that testimonial beliefs are formed directly but justified from other beliefs

@lackey2005:163 (“non–reductionists maintain that testimony is just as basic a source of justification (knowledge, warrant, entitlement, and so forth) as sense-perception, memory, inference, and the like”)

Testimony can be used to deceive in a way OM&I can't.

Determinism & deception 

> the fact that testimony comes from a person, rather than an inanimate object, is a reason to be more demanding on testimonially-based beliefs than on perceptually-based beliefs."

> “[T] must in some sense, though not necessarily by conscious choice, select what to attend to, and in doing so can also lie or, in a certain way, mislead … For the basic sources, there is no comparable analogue of such voluntary representation of information.” @audi2006:40

See @faulkner2000, @lackey2006:176, @lackey2006:188 

>  If the possibility of deception is a good reason to think that S requires positive reasons to believe T, then there seems to be equally strong reason to require that S have positive reasons to believe that the objects of her perceptually-based beliefs are genuine. The conservative might respond that deception may sometimes be at stake in a perceptually-based belief, but deception is always a possibility for testimonially-based ones. However, this seems clearly untrue as a conceptual matter; it is at least possible for T to be a reliable robot lacking freedom.

See @Green2006:82

Gullibility - why should S treat T as honest and competent?

See @green2006:67, @fricker1997

Defeasibility

Testimony is defeasible by other sources of belief in a way OM&I isn't. Testimony can be verified via other means while OM&I are basic.

See @Plantinga1993 and @Audi2006

No-defeater conditions

> S’s entitlement to believe T is defeasible, if other contrary information about p, or about T, is available to S.

Positive reasons to believe are needed 

> including such a requirement, but not a requirement of positive reasons to believe in T’s reliability, would be inconsistent, or an “untenable half-way house.” 

> S lacks knowledge or justification where S has no evidence that T is reliable.

See @bonjour1980 & @bonjour2003

Higher-order beliefs

S needs to have other beliefs about the reliability and trustworthiness of T.

> “Once a hearer forms belief that [p] on a teller T’s say-so, she is consequently committed to the proposition that T knows that [p]. But her belief about T which constitutes this trust, antecedent to her utterance, is something like this: T is such that not easily would she assert that [p], vouch for the truth of [p], unless she knew that [p].” @fricker2006b:600 

> “When we form beliefs through perception, we may do so automatically, without any particular belief about how our perceptual system works. When we form beliefs through testimony, at some level we are aware that we are believing what a person says, and that this person is presenting her testimony as her own belief.” @Weiner2003

One criticism of testimonial justification is that it usually lacks sufficient inductive base to verify as true.  There are a number of defences however.

> “[W]hat matters is not the proportion of testimonial beliefs I have checked, but the proportion of checks taken that have had positive results.” @vancleve2006:68.

Testimony can normally only be interpreted via other testimony.  So if testimony isn't generally reliable, the we can't interpret testimony in the first place.

> [E]ven a young child’s trust in testimony can be justified by her own perception and memory. In order for people’s utterances to be testimonial evidence for her, the child must have interpreted the utterances, but the kind of experience that allows her to interpret the utterances is also the kind of experience that supports the general credibility of testimony. @Shogenji2006:339

As such, the epistemic demands for testimony need not be more than for perception.

Perhaps testimony requires lower standards ...

> Moran 2005, Ross 1986, and Hinchman 2005 and 2007 argue that, because the testifier T has assumed responsibility for the truth of p, S’s responsibilities are necessarily lessened. In telling S that p, T is not offering S evidence that p, but instead asking S to trust him.

## Testifier side (T-side) issues

> If S’s testimonially-based knowledge that p requires T’s (or someone’s) knowledge that p, it would seem that testimony is “a second-class citizen of the epistemic republic,” as Plantinga 1993:87 puts it, because, unlike perception, testimony is not a source of knowledge for the epistemic community as a whole; it is only a way of spreading knowledge around that community.

One response ...

>  Graham 2000:365 takes a similar view, explaining it at length: “According to the model I prefer, knowledge is not transferred through communication, rather Information is conveyed.”
