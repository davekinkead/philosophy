# The philosophy of simulation: hot new issues or same old stew?

## Frigg & Reiss 2009

> We argue that these claims are overblown and that simulations, far from demanding a new metaphysics, epistemology, semantics and methodology, raise few if any new philosophical problems. p593

Frigg & Riess examine and reject a number of claims made by proponents regarding the novelty of computer simulations in science.  

>  The main tenor in this literature is that computer simulations not only constitute interesting and powerful new science, but that they also raise a host of new philosophical issues. p594

The claims can be divided into: 

> Metaphysical: Simulations create some kind of parallel world in which experiments can be conducted under more favourable conditions than in the ‘real world’.   
> Epistemic: Simulations demand a new epistemology.  
> Semantic: Simulations demand a new analysis of how models/theories relate to concrete phenomena.  
> Methodological: Simulating is a Sui Generis activity that lies ‘in between’ theorising and experimentation.  
> (p 595)

Their claims is that while simulations offer something new to science, they don't create anything new for the philosophy of science.

> Simulations increase the range of phenomena that are epistemically accessible to us in a way comparable to scientific instruments such as microscopes or telescopes. p594

"Computer simulations extend the class of tractable mathematics and thereby broaden the range of modelling tools that we can use." p594

"...computational techniques ‘constitutes a significant and permanent addition to the methods of science..." p594

"...transform theoretical structures into specific concrete knowledge of physical systems..." p594

> "In sum, we agree that simulations introduce something new and exciting into science, but we doubt that this requires us to rewrite the philosophy of science." p595

Defining simulation  (p596)

> Those who put forward the claims of the philosophical novelty of simulation, how- ever, focus on using digital computers in situations involving analytically intracta- ble equations (see Winsberg 1999, pp. 275, 278; 2001, p. 444; 2003, pp. 107–108; Humphreys 2004, p. 49)

> In the narrow sense, ‘simulation’ refers to the use of a computer to solve an equation that we cannot solve analytically, or more generally to explore mathematical proper- ties of equations where analytical methods fail (e.g., Humphreys 1991, p. 501; 2004, p. 49; Winsberg 1999, p. 275; 2001, p. 444).

> In the broad sense, ‘simulation’ refers to the entire process of constructing, using, and justifying a model that involves analytically intractable mathematics (e.g., Wins- berg 2001, p. 443; 2003, p. 105; Humphreys 1991, p. 501; 2004, p. 107). Following Humphreys (2004, pp. 102–104), we call such a model a ‘computational model’.

Others:

> Thus we endorse Humphreys’ conclusion that computational techniques ‘constitutes a significant and permanent addition to the methods of science’ (2004, p. 64).

> Several philosophers, historians and scientists claim that simulations create ‘parallel’ (or ‘virtual’ or ‘artificial’) worlds (cf. Galison 1996, from which we quoted above, Edwards 2001, Sterman 2006). 

> Winsberg (2001) ascribes three features to the allegedly distinct epistemology of simulation: it is downward [Simulation is about starting with theory and working your way down], autonomous [Difficult to compare to reality] and motley [resorts to other approximations, idealizations and even ‘falsifications’]
