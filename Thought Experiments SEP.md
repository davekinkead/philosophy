# Thought Experiments

> Thought experiments are devices of the imagination used to investigate the nature of things. Most often .... communicated in narrative form, frequently with diagrams.

> there should be something experimental about a thought experiment.

> The primary philosophical challenge of thought experiments is simple: How can we learn about reality (if we can at all), just by thinking?

> Philosophy without thought experiments seems almost hopeless.

Examples from science & philosophy

> Maxwell's demon, Einstein's elevator or Schrödinger's cat.
> Galileo, Descartes, Newton, and Leibniz
> Searle's Chinese room, Putnam's twin earth, Thomson's violinist, and Jackson's Mary the colour scientist

Uses

> Some thought experiments fulfil a specific function within a theory (see Boorsboom et al., 2002). Others are executed because it is impossible to run the experimental scenario in the real world (see Sorensen, 1992, pp. 200–202). Sometimes thought experiments help to illustrate and clarify very abstract states of affairs, thereby accelerating the process of understanding (see Behmel, 2001). Again others serve as examples in conceptual analysis (see Cohnitz, 2006). Most attention is received by those that are taken to provide evidence in favour of or against a theory, putting them on a par with real-world experiments (see Gendler, 2004)

Destuctive Experiments:

A thought experiment shows that a theory has interntal contradictions (Galileo's falling bodies to show the contradiction in Aristotle's account)

A TE shows theory contradicts other important beliefs or theories (Schrödinger's cat)

A TE shows that a key premise in the TE is undermined by the conclusion (JJT's violinist)

A counter TE shows that some of the original TE is dubious.

Constructive Experiments:

A TE acts as a heuristic to deepen our understanding what we already know empirically.

A TE acts as an 'intuition pump'

Typical Process:

> we visualize some situation that we have set up in the imagination; 
> we let it run or we carry out an operation; 
> we see what happens; 
> finally, we draw a conclusion. 

Why

> Often a real experiment that is the analogue of a thought experiment is impossible for physical, technological, ethical, or financial reasons (see, e.g., Sorensen, 1992, pp. 200–202); 

A key philosophical question: 

> How is it possible to learn apparently new things about nature without new empirical data?

History

> Pre-Socratics... “invented thought experimentation as a cognitive procedure and practiced it with great dedication and versatility.” (Rescher, 2005, p. 2; see also Diamond, 2002, pp. 229–232; Glas, 1999; Ierodiakonou, 2005; Irvine, 1991; Rescher, 1991 and 2005, pp. 61–72)

> According to Grant (2007, 201), during the late Middle Ages “the imagination became a formidable instrument in natural philosophy and theology in ways that would have astonished” ancient Greek natural philosophers, especially Aristotle.

The skeptical objection:

> Duhem, the great historian of physics, is almost alone in what has been understood as an outright condemnation of scientific thought experiments (see Duhem, 1913, pp. 304–311). A thought experiment is no substitute for a real experiment, he claimed, and should be forbidden in science, including science education.

> “A popular strategy in philosophy is to construct a certain sort of thought experiment I call intuition pump. […] Intuition pumps are often abused, though seldom deliberately.” (Dennett, 1985, p. 12)

> Wilkes wants philosophy “to use science fact rather than science fiction or fantasy” (Wilkes, 1988, p. 1), and therefore to refrain from using thought experiments because they are “both problematic and positively misleading.” (Wilkes, 1988, p. 2)

> Wilkes's concern that thought experimenting seems to be constrained only by relevant logical impossibilities and what seems intuitively acceptable. 

> Timothy Williamson has argued that we should forget about intuition as a cushion in the philosophical armchair (see Williamson, 2004a,b, 2008, pp. 179–207, and 2009). 

> David Chalmers thinks that good thought experiments can be a guide to possibilities if the entailments of conceivability and possibility that he defends are sound (p. 153)


Thought Experiments vs Computer Simulations

> the relationship between computer simulation and thought experiments has started to attract attention (see Behmel, 2001, pp. 98–108; Di Paolo et al., 2000; El Skaf and Imbert, 2013; Lenhard 2011; Stäudner, 1998).

> Accordingly, it has been argued that “computational modeling is largely replacing thought experimenting, and the latter will play only a limited role in future practice of science, especially in the sciences of complex nonlinear, dynamical phenomena” (see Chandrasekharan et al., 2012, p. 239).

> Maybe related to this is the proposal of Schulzke (2014) to think of video games philosophically as executable thought experiments.
