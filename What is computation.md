# What is computation?

> Computation is the transformation of sequences of symbols according to precise rules. (p5)

Computation is applied to symbols, not numbers (see the Syntax / Semantic distinciton).

Computation can be non-numeric ... algebraic computation, proof computation, finding a word in text etc.

> Leaving the narrow scope of mathematics, wefind a huge number of domainswhere computation is applied to textual data. Finding a word in a text is acomputation: it transforms the input data (the text and the word to look for)into output data (the position in the textwhere the word occurs), both of whichcan be encoded as sequences of symbols (p6)

> It is worth making a distinction betweencomputationas a tool andcomputersas a tool. Computers perform computations, but they also deal with other tasks. (p7)

The quote from Knuth ...

> It has often been said that a person does not really understand something untilhe teaches it to someone else. Actually a person does not really understandsomething until he can teach it to a computer, i.e. express it as an algorithm.The attempt to formalize things as algorithms leads to a much deeper under-standing than if we simply try to comprehend things in the traditional way. (Knuth D E 1974 Computer science and its relation to mathematicsAm.  Math.  Mon.81323–43)

> The utility of writing programs for understanding scientific concepts and mathe-matical models comes from the extreme rigor and precision required in program-ming. (p7)

> In the physical sciences, most theories take the form of differential equations ... which fully define their solutions, and are also useful for reasoning about their general proper-ties, but provide no obvious way offindingone. (p7)

> Implementing a scientific model as a computer program also has the advantagethat, as a bonus, you get a tool for exploring the consequences of the model forsimple applications. (p8)

> In the study of complex systems, with models that are directly formulated asalgorithms, computational exploration is often the only approach to gaining scientific insight (p8) (see Downey A B 2012Think  Complexity:  Complexity  Science  and  Computational  Modeling1st edn (Sebastopol, CA: O’Reilly Media))

Computer programs that implements a model about some domain is an expression of scientific knowledge. (p8)
